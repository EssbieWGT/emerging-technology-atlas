### U.S. Federal Blockchain Forum

<p><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/event/in-person-u-s-federal-blockchain-forum/">The U.S. Federal Blockchain Forum</a> was an inter-agency forum hosted at General Services Administration July 18, 2017, for executives across the federal government to learn about advances in Blockchain technology, discuss use cases and set an agenda for working together to evaluate and implement it among our diverse missions.</p>

<p>These rough draft use cases represent initial ideas and moonshots as well as program in development, and should be considered only proposed use cases and concepts unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p>42. Blockchain based network that democratises access to siloed inventory (foreclosure, repossessed inventory) data by enabling sellers (local counties, sheriffs, municipalities, customs) to hold multi-merchant auctioning through a distributed network. Forming an open marketplace, where any online merchant store can join and re-market, auction the same inventory in sync with global network of such intermediary online stores.</p>

<p>43. Reduce the high overhead cost of traditional trade finance solutions through commercial banks to help small businesses export American products overseas. Explore blockchain applications for trade finance insurance and government-backed working capital guarantee products.

Management of clinical trial protocols, data, and patient databases using blockchain ledgers.</p>

<p>44. Determine the feasibility of using blockchain in a permission-based DLT platform as the foundation for a government-wide software license entitlement exchange as mandated by Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). This would expand on work started by DHS and NIST championing the adoption of ISO-19770 software identity (SWID) tags to enhance cyber security and IT Service Management operations.</p>

<p>45. Pilot program for fresh produce contracts/procurements by school districts with USDA approved vendors to utilize entitlement funds and enhance local procurement volume. Orders, receipts, bills of lading, invoices, approved vendors and products visibility for USDA agencies, state agencies, school districts and vendors to verify compliance with pilot rules, auditability and ensure prompt payment. Currently 2 federal agencies, 8 states, 400+ school districts and 90+ vendors participate in a manual validation and tracking process.</p>

<p>46. Utilize hackathons to discover innovative approaches to BC usage, exploitation.</p>

<p>47. A public blockchain to store encrypted chain of custody records as a way to increase public trust by providing an immutable record that could include hashes of digital files collected in an investigation.</p>

<p>48. Human Capital Employee Digital Record - build out network of partners (gov and industry) and exchange incremental updates between members</p>

<p>49. Tax refunds. Possible reduction of fraud. With tax submission as well.</p>

<p>50. Blockchain technology in existing data acquisition, storage, and retrieval system for traumatic brain injury (TBI) allowing for improved accuracy of individualized patient data which will allow for better prognostic and diagnostic determinations for individual service members who experience TBI.</p>

<p>51. Putting our University engagement program - Diplomacy Lab - on blockchain in order to securely share research products between Department offices and to manage transactions of research assets between university researchers and State entities.</p>

<p>52. If an SEC registrant uses a blockchain to record data the SEC has access to pursuant to its regulatory authority, a proposed use is that the SEC be given access to a œregulatory node on that registrant’s blockchain with permission to read that data in real time.</p>

<p>53. Blockchain's potential for improving data access and security in consumer affairs.</p>

<p>54. Non-ID response. This challenge occurs when a respondent provide information does not have a pre-provided unique ID. For example, if a individual responding to the decennial census on a generic form from their public library vs. using the one mailed to their house that contains their ID.</p>

<p>55. Legal entity identifier (LEI) management, financial research revolving around public/private blockchains in the US financial system.</p>

<p>56. DHS employs a public-private partnership model for sharing private sector security information to identify potential threats to and to reduce risk to critical infrastructure. The protected critical infrastructure information (PCII) program is in place to protect private sector infrastructure information voluntarily shared with the government for these purposes. Blockchain could be applied as an enhanced security and validation tool to create digital identities that protect this private sector information and maintain privacy.</p>

<p>57. The ability to create and share records using blockchain across agencies.</p>
