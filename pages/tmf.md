A combination of bold and innovative emerging technology solutions including Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation piloted and tested by agencies across government with the operational rigor and funding of the Technology Modernization Fund holds the potential to drive to incredible performance advancements in public services. 

GSA’s Technology Modernization Fund Program Management Office (TMF PMO) and Emerging Citizen Technology Office (ECTO) are partnering this summer to help agencies apply these advances in emerging technologies and processes to IT modernization efforts that can improve our services and reduce costs for the American people today and in the coming years. 

The main mechanism of this collaboration is to work side-by-side with agencies across government to create a submission pipeline for emerging technology proposals that may tap into the initial $100 million Technology Modernization Fund in order to replace legacy systems and deliver on the potential and promise of IT modernization. 

We are hosting a workshop at GSA on June 8, 2018, [“Funding the Future: Emerging Technologies for Federal IT Modernization”](https://digital.gov/event/2018/06/08/funding-future-technology-modernization-fund-proposal-workshop/) to launch efforts to assist agencies with developing proposals. More details and registration information for this workshop are coming. This is just one of the many programming and development opportunities we will collaborate with agencies to facilitate in the coming weeks. 

### What is the Technology Modernization Fund?

The TMF provides a new funding model for Federal technology modernization projects. Agencies may submit project proposals for technology modernization projects to the Technology Modernization Board (Board). For FY 18, the Board will award $100 million to submitted projects. Approved projects will receive funds in an incremental manner, tied to specific project milestones and objectives, and will be regularly monitored by the Board for success.

### What projects qualify for the Technology Modernization Fund?

The Board will consider project proposals based on financial, technical, and operational criteria. All federal government agencies can submit project proposals to the TMF. A full list of requirements for submission, as well as a template, can be found in <a href="https://policy.cio.gov/modernizing-government-technology/">Appendix A of OMB M-18-12</a>. A <a href="https://policy.cio.gov/assets/APPENDIXA.docx">word document template</a> can also be found on the OMB Modernizing Government Technology site.
