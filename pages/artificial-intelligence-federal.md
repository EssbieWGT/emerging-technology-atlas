These draft use cases represent initial ideas and moonshots as well as programs in development, and should be considered only proposed use cases and concepts unless otherwise noted. Anyone is encouraged to contribute their own use case or expand analysis of ideas at any state of development.

 Common trends in use cases evaluated by federal agencies, particularly involving Natural Language Processing, include:
1. Customer service, call and contact centers
2. Emergency response and management
3. Accessibility for persons with disabilities
4. Multi-lingual services

As noted in a recent tongue-in-cheek post, however, <a href="https://qz.com/1067123/stop-pretending-you-really-know-what-ai-is-and-read-this-instead/"><span>"Stop pretending you really know what AI is and read this instead,"</span></a> (non-government link, not endorsed) there is a recognized challenge in defining what exactly is AI and is not AI, and what uses are the most practical for improving citizen services. This Atlas serves to help open that process to ensure federal efforts develop based on shared experience and deter duplication.

[1. Emerging Tech and Open Data for a More Open and Accountable Government Collaborative Workshop, September 8, 2017](/workshop/). At our collaborative workshop held on September 8, 2017, Emerging Technology and Open Data for a More Open Government, over 90 participants from 47 teams from government, industry, civil society, and academia came together and crafted potential goals to be integrated into the fourth U.S. National Action Plan for Open Government. 27 of those concepts are shared here.

Federal Inter-Agency Artificial Intelligence Personal Assistant Pilot</span></a> This links out to the repository from a recent Federal AI Personal Assistant Pilot. Included are 27 federal programs programs who have requested to participate in pilot, with rough placeholder information that is updated and refined by individual agencies. Content may include: Problem statement; Product strategy; Identification of supporting public data sets/APIs.
