## Artificial Intelligence

Public services are increasingly powered through the combination of greater access to data and practical advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that deliver solutions from research and development laboratories into the hands of programs everywhere.

The Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services program is designed to collaborate with agencies across government, U.S. businesses, researchers, and the public to improve customer services, civic participation, and access for the American people.

## Robotic Process Automation 

Government programs can make their programs more effective and efficient by "taking the robot out of our human" workforce with automation, eliminating wasted time and effort and empowering employees to dedicate their full resources to more high impact activities. 

## Blockchain

Federal agencies are eager to better evaluate, test and potentially adopt distributed ledger technologies like Blockchain that use encryption and coding to improve transparency, efficiency and trust in information sharing.

## Social Media

The Federal SocialGov Community was launched in June 2012 to research, evaluate and implement emerging social technologies and strategies for public services for more engaging, collaborative and responsive digital programs.

The U.S. Digital Registry, which is the official resource agencies, citizens and developers use to confirm the official status of social media and public-facing collaboration accounts, mobile apps and mobile websites. This creates an additional layer of security by helping prevent exploitation from unofficial sources, phishing scams or malicious entities.

## Virtual and Augmented Reality

Immersive enhanced audio and visual experiences through virtual and augmented reality are now available to the American public through smartphones and other mobile devices, opening the door to an incredible diversity of new programs and services.

Federal agencies are eager to share their ideas on how this new medium might expand and improve their servicesâ€“using virtual therapy to treat PTSD or disaster management preparedness and response. To help explore and share these great ideas, we host workshops where agencies and industry specialists can brainstorm and demonstrate the new technologies.
