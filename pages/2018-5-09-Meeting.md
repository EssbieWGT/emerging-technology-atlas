### New Business
#### Amazon Lex Demo, Tim Wilson, Amazon Web Services
* Tim gave a demonstration of a variety of AWS products including Sumerian, Lex, & Amazon's IoT service. 
* Amazon Lex is similar to the Alexa voice assistant, but while Alexa is only for Amazon Echo devices, Lex offers the same capability for any web-enabled device. 
* Amazon Sumerian is a VR/AR application for interactive 3D visuals. 
* Amazon’s IoT service creates the link between the physical and digital world, linking physical machinery, to a VR/AR model of the same machine.
* The demo included the following components:
  * Scanning a QR code on a conveyor belt, using an iPad, to create an AR version of that belt displayed on the screen. 
  * Information such as vibrations, rotations per minute, & the devices status are all displayed. 
  * A click of a button changes the mode to an “exploded” version of the conveyor belt that breaks out each individual part. 
  * In the future, this “exploded” mode will be able to highlight a specific gear or bolt that isn’t working, so engineers can proactively diagnose problems and more easily fix a large piece of machinery, without having to dismantle the entire product.

#### Announcements
