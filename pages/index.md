# Welcome to the U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas

Hello Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation can hold the key to unlocking the vast potential of public services and open data for the American people, but they evolve at a speed that can be challenging for federal IT modernization efforts. 

This U.S. Emerging Citizen Technology Atlas is an open source resource organized by GSA's Emerging Citizen Technology Office (ECTO), launched in October 2017, in partnership with innovative programs and people across government to help tear down the barriers so anyone from public servants and policy-makers to U.S. businesses, researchers, and the public can learn and share updates with:

1. Uses and resources for the practical application of emerging technologies;
2. Reports from public service workshops, pilots, and programs;
3. Opportunities to participate and collaborate.

This Atlas is just one public-facing resource in a collaborative support and coordination effort to improve outcomes and reduce duplication of effort.

These are just a fraction of the expansive emerging technology programs and services within the U.S. federal government, a continual work-in-progress designed to empower you to know what we know and help us all be better informed to take advantage of new opportunities and avoid pitfalls.

We look forward to working with you to build the future now.
