### Blockchain Potential Use Cases

These draft use cases represent initial ideas and moonshots as well as programs in development, and should be considered only proposed use cases and concepts unless otherwise noted. Anyone is encouraged to contribute their own use case at any state of development.

Common trends in use cases evaluated by federal agencies include:
1. Financial management
2. Procurement
3. IT asset and supply chain management
4. Smart contracts
5. Patents, Trademarks Copyrights, Royalties
6. Government-issued credentials like visas, passports, SSN and birth certificates
7. Federal personnel workforce data
8. Appropriated funds
9. Federal assistance and foreign aid delivery

It is important to remember, however, that not all proposed use cases are equal in promise, and for this reason open analysis, test and evaluation are critical. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-10-mistakes-in-enterprise-blockchain-projects/"><span> As noted by Gartner in Top 10 Mistakes in Enterprise Blockchain Projects, </span></a> (non-government link, not endorsed) "part of the problem is that the majority of enterprise blockchain projects donâ€™t actually require blockchain technology. In fact, these projects would probably be more successful if they did not utilize blockchain."

This Atlas serves to help open that process to ensure federal efforts develop based on shared experience and deter duplication.

#### Draft use case sources:

1. [Emerging Tech and Open Data for a More Open and Accountable Government Collaborative Workshop, September 8, 2017](/blockchain-workshop/). At our collaborative workshop held on September 8, 2017, Emerging Technology and Open Data for a More Open Government, over 90 participants from 47 teams from government, industry, civil society, and academia came together and crafted potential goals to be integrated into the fourth U.S. National Action Plan for Open Government. 35 proposals are shared here.
2. [U.S. Federal Blockchain Forum, July 18, 2017](/blockchain-forum/). The U.S. Federal Blockchain Forum was an inter-agency forum with 62 participating government offices hosted at General Services Administration July 18, 2017, for executives across the federal government to learn about advances in Blockchain technology, discuss use cases and set an agenda for working together to evaluate and implement it among our diverse missions. 79 of those concepts are shared here.
