### United States Agency for International Development
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has published a report on the potential of blockchain technology. The [USAID Primer on Blockchain](https://www.usaid.gov/digital-development/digital-finance/blockchain-primer), published April 2018, equips USAID staff, implementing partners, and others to better understand if and how distributed ledger technology-based applications and/or digital currency (e.g. a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin) could help address development challenges—whether in health, agriculture, governance, finance, trade, humanitarian assistance, or energy.

### Centers for Disease Control
For the past several months, the CDC’s Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services has worked on several proofs of concept based on blockchain technology, with an eye toward building real applications next year. Most are geared toward better public health surveillance, which could include using a blockchain to more efficiently manage data during a crisis or to better track opioid abuse.

### Department of Defense
The The Joint Staff, J4 Logistics Directorate and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Maintenance, Policy, and Programs are co-leading a project to create a “point of use, time of need” digital supply chain enabled by Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) and Blockchain. With the introduction of distributed manufacturing, the path from design engineering to manufacturing now includes a digital distribution phase. As the digital thread extends connectivity deep into manufacturing supply chains, cyber security must be an integral part of any successful manufacturing roadmap. AM files can be easily transmitted with the click of a mouse. The digital nature of AM means that parts and products are easier to share and transmit, enabling the creation of a digital supply network and supply chains. AM, with its reliance on the digital thread, is one area which can be especially vulnerable to cyber threats and intrusions. In order to fully realize the benefits of AM within a defined distribution network, secure data transport must be addressed. Blockchain is one solution to mitigate those risks.

Participants include: Joint Staff, J4; OSD, DASD MPP; OSD, Chief Information Office; Joint Staff Innovation Group; Dept of Commerce, National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST); National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS); Commercial Technologies for Maintenance Activities (CTMA); United States Navy; United States Army; United States Marine Corps; United States Air Force; Defense Logistics Agency; and Industry Partners.


### U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Launched in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Innovation, Design, Entrepreneurship and Action (IDEA) Lab, Information Exchange and Data Transformation (INFORMED) is an incubator for collaborative oncology regulatory science research focused on supporting innovations that enhance FDA’s mission of promotion and protection of the public health. It is exploring the utility of open-access platforms and emerging technologies such as blockchain to enable secure exchange of health data at scale. According to the upcoming ACT-IAC Blockchain Primer resource, "this includes the exchange of electronic medical records (EMRs) and other information such as genomic data, clinical trial information, and data collected from IOT devices and wearables. Blockchain can provide an audit trail by tracking changes to the EMR as well as help track and control access to the EMR. Blockchain can provide healthcare providers with the longitudinal data about a patient without having the actual protected health information (PHI) reside on the actual ledger."

### General Services Administration
Schedule 70: The General Services Administration (GSA) is using distributed ledger technology to automate the FASt Lane process for IT Schedule 70 contracts. The FAStlane program ensures government customer agencies have quicker access to emerging technologies and innovative suppliers. Currently the requirements are less than 48 hours for contract modifications, and 45 days (or less) for new offers. At the September 20 ACT-IAC (American Council for Technology and Industry Advisory Council) Forum Mr. Jose Arrieta unveiled the working prototype created by two companies, United Solutions (prime contractor) and Sapient Consulting (subcontractor). The prototype will shorten the time required to perform the contract review process into single digit days. This technology will allow the agency to track vendor data across disparate systems.
